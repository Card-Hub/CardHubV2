    <h1>Blackjack Rules</h1>
    <p>Blackjack is a card game where the goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards. The value of each card is as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value</li>
      <li>Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points</li>
      <li>Aces are worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on which value benefits the player more</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The game begins with each player receiving two cards. Players can choose to "hit" (draw another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand). The player with the highest hand value that does not exceed 21 wins the round. If a player's hand value exceeds 21, they "bust" and lose the round.</p>
    <p>Blackjack is a game of skill and strategy, as players must decide when to hit, stand, double down, or split their hand. The game also involves an element of luck, as players cannot control the cards they are dealt.</p>
