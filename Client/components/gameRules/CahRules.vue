    <h1>CAH Rules</h1>
    <p>CAH is a party game where players complete fill-in-the-blank statements using words or phrases typically deemed as offensive, risqu√©, or politically incorrect printed on playing cards. The game is played with a deck of white cards, which contain the fill-in-the-blank statements, and black cards, which contain the questions or fill-in-the-blank prompts. The game is typically played with a group of players who take turns being the Card Czar, who selects the winning card combination for each round.</p>
